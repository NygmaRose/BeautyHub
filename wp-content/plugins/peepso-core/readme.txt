== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is PeepSo GDPR Compliant? =

PeepSo does have the options and configuration settings that will help you as a responsible site administrator with efforts to meet the obligations and rights enacted under the GDPR. Please note that the configuration options for the GDPR that are built-in PeepSo are covering only our plugins. Should you be using any other 3rd party software that also needs to be GDPR compliant needs to be covered by its respective developers. PeepSo does NOT cover 3rd party solutions under its GDPR compliance features. As a responsible site administrator you yourself must ensure that any and all parts of your website are GDPR compliant when the law applies. 

= Can I use my existing theme? =

We've tested PeepSo with dozens of major themes. But since there are thousands of themes for WordPress, it'd hard for us to test with all of them. Well, virtually impossible. The theme we recommend is [Divi](http://peep.so/et).

You can check PeepSo (it's free) with that theme and if you find any problems, please report them and we'll fix whatever PeepSo might be breaking. However, if the case is that the theme itself is interfering with PeepSo's styles and overriding them in any way, there's nothing we'd be able to do. You'd have to contact the theme developers to get that fixed.

= Where do I find translations? =

Translations are included within the plugin.

Yes! You can find documentation on the use of PeepSo and designing themes and extensions for PeepSo at [PeepSo Docs](https://docs.peepso.com/)
